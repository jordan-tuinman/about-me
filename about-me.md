# About me
 
I first entered the tech industry when I moved to Tokyo in 2015, working for Microsoft in networking and data centre operations. There I learned to love learning and picked up an interest in the tooling and web apps that we used. 
Since moving back to New Zealand, I have steered into software development to fulfil my passion for creating useful tools and helping people.

Jumping into a bootcamp with Enspiral Dev Academy (EDA) was a challenging but incredibly fun way to kick start my journey into development. We spent 60 hour weeks coding on real problems in pairs and group projects, and over the course of 15 weeks covered a full stack. Our final project was a Habit Formation app called [Positively]() based on my own idea, which was created in just seven days in a team of 6 students.
