# About me
 
I am a full stack developer with a passion for front end and user experience. I enjoy making software that assists people in improving their lives, that looks great and is intuitive to use. I first entered the tech industry when I moved to Tokyo, working for Microsoft in networking and data centre operations. There I learned to love learning and picked up an interest in the tooling and web apps that we used. 
Since moving back to New Zealand, I have steered into software development to fulfil my passion for creating useful tools and helping people.

I am searching for a role where I can develop myself and learn new skills, and grow to become an integral part of a team by utilising my past experiences and ability to work with people from all sorts of unique backgrounds and cultures. 

In my spare time I enjoy rolling around in pajamas at my local Brazilian Jiu Jitsu club ü•ã    
Also, I'm fluent in Japanese so I enjoy reading and watching crazy Japanese game shows.
