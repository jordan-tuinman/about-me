# About me
 
I am a full stack developer with a passion for front end and user experience. I enjoy making software that assists people in improving their lives, that looks great and is intuitive to use. I first entered the tech industry when I moved to Tokyo, working for Microsoft in networking and data centre operations. There I learned to love learning and picked up an interest in the tooling and web apps that we used. 
Since moving back to New Zealand, I have steered into software development to fulfil my passion for creating useful tools and helping people.

Jumping into a bootcamp with Enspiral Dev Academy was a challenging but incredibly fun way to kick start my development knwoledge. We spent 60hour weeks coding on real problems, in pairs and group projects, and over the course of 15 weeks cover a full stack. 

I am now searching for a role where I can develop myself and learn new skills, and grow to become an integral part of a team by utilising my past experiences and ability to work with people from all sorts of unique backgrounds and cultures. 

In my spare time I enjoy rolling around in pajamas at my local Brazilian Jiu Jitsu club ü•ã    
Also, I'm fluent in Japanese so I enjoy reading and watching crazy Japanese game shows.
