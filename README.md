# Jordan Tuinman - @jordan-tuinman
 
Hi, I'm Jordan - a full stack developer with a passion creating intuitive software that assists people in improving their lives. I especially enjoy working with JavaScript, React and Redux. 

In my spare time I enjoy rolling around in pajamas at my local Brazilian Jiu Jitsu club ðŸ¥‹    
Also, I'm fluent in Japanese so I enjoy reading and watching crazy Japanese game shows. 

Currently I'm searching for a role where I can learn new skills and become a valuable member of a team, utilising my past experiences and ability to work with people from all sorts of unique backgrounds and cultures.
