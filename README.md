# Jordan Tuinman - @jordan-tuinman
 
Hi, I'm Jordan - a full stack developer with a passion creating intuitive software that assists people in improving their lives.

In my spare time I enjoy rolling around in pajamas at my local Brazilian Jiu Jitsu gym ðŸ¥‹    
Also, I'm fluent in Japanese so I enjoy reading and watching crazy Japanese game shows.
