## About me	

I am a full stack developer with a passion for making software that assists people in improving their lives, that looks great and is intuitive to use. I first entered the tech industry when I moved to Tokyo, working for Microsoft in networking and data centre operations. There I learned to love learning and picked up an interest in the tooling and web apps that we used. Since moving back to New Zealand, I have steered into software development to fulfil my passion for creating useful tools and helping people.
I am searching for a role where I can develop myself and learn new skills, and grow to become an integral part of a team by utilising my past experiences and ability to work with people from all sorts of unique backgrounds and cultures.

## Experience

### Full Stack Developer – Student
Enspiral Dev Academy | Remote - NZ
December 2020 – March 2021

A 15-week full immersion software development bootcamp, that mimics a real-life agile development team experience. Every week involved putting in at least 60 hours of work, coding on real problems and finding solutions. 
*	Developed my ability to pick up and run with new technology quickly, through learning how to efficiently self-reflect and perseverance. 
*	Through daily pair-programming and weekly group projects I learned to be a strong communicator, especially due to working with people remotely who I had never met before.  A large part of this was receiving and providing constructive feedback in a safe space.
*	Utilised strict git workflows to avoid conflicts and ensure clean code, along with robust testing.
*	Excelled in group projects, especially in our final project where we developed an app within seven days. The project we chose was based on one of my ideas and so I took on the Product Owner role, as well as a developer role.
*	My team created an easy-to-use habit formation platform called Positively, that seamlessly renders components using React and Redux. We made use of the whole tech stack we had learned during the bootcamp, as well as new tech such as Passport.js to include authorisation. [link to project]

*	Quickly got up to speed on a part of the IT hardware industry that was new to me, and was able to sit in on project planning meetings and gain certification in audio design.
*	Gained experience in de-escalating situations in person, and face-to-face resolution of issues.
*	Increased and reinforced my ability to explain technical concepts and information to non-tech people.
*	Created new documentation and processes to better manage project information, inventory and incoming goods.
